# 42 Warsaw – System Programming Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio and index of my projects completed as part of the **42 Warsaw** project-based curriculum.  
The focus of these projects is on **system-level programming, algorithms, memory management, and Unix/Linux fundamentals**, implemented primarily in **C**.
